# Jonckheere-Terpstra test

## Available R packages

As far as I know, the following packages are available:

-   DescTools
-   clinfun
-   StatCharrms
-   PMCMRplus
-   fastJT

Due to availability in the company, DescTools is used to compare the results with SAS.

## Data used

The data for testing is a sample dataset on a dose-response study.

The Group indicates a dose of a drug. The scores for Group represent ordering of dose arms. Then the boxplot implies a declining dose-response relationship.

## Example Code

```{r}

```

### Example using

**Optional** if there is more than one package

## Comparison

If you are comparing more than one package or between different languages, consider adding in a table to illustrate some of the differences. When comparing between languages it can be nice to have a table with links to the pages with deeper dive of each language for a given method method like this table from the ANCOVA page:

| Analysis                                      | Supported in R          | Supported in SAS          | Results Match | Notes                                                                                    |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| ANCOVA using general linear model and lsmeans | [Yes](../R/ancova.html) | [Yes](../SAS/ancova.html) | [Yes](#comp)  | `GLM()` function from **sasLM** with `EMEANS=TRUE` is the easiest to use and matches SAS |

But, even if you are just comparing the difference in same language it can be helpful to have a table with values of interest across different packages. Using dynamic content you can add the values to a table without manually putting in each value

## Conclusion
