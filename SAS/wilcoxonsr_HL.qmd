title: "Wilcoxon signed-rank test in SAS & StatXact"
---

### **Introduction**

Similarily to what has been presented in R, we will explore the options of Wilcoxon signed-rank test that are avialable in SAS & StatXact.We will consider case with N\>=20 or N\<20 and without or with ties. For more information how to perform this analysis in R go [here](../R/wilcoxonsr_hodges_lehman.qmd)

### Data {.unnumbered}

Analysis was be conducted on the same example dataset as in R.

Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to analyse the time to return to baseline FEV1 post-mannitol challenge 2. This time only median difference and p value were provided due to SAS' limitations.

### Dataset without ties and N\>= 20 {.unnumbered}

Let's consider a case where the dataset has no ties and N (numbr of observations) = 240.

```{r}
#| eval: false
data TTR;
	set TTR;
	diff = TRT_B - TRT_A;
run;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/wilcoxonsr/wsr_data.PNG")
```

### Analysis in SAS {.unnumbered}

In SAS Wilcoxon signed-rank test is available using PROC UNIVARIATE.

```{r}
#| eval: false
proc univariate data=TTR
	alpha=0.1
  CIquantNORMAL (type=twosided alpha=0.1)
  pctldef = 2;   
	var diff;
run;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/wilcoxonsr/wsr_240.PNG")
```
