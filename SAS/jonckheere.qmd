## Jonckheere-Terpstra test in SAS

The Jonckheere-Terpstra test can be conducted using the FREQ procedure. Specifically, it can be done by setting the jt option in the TABLES statement.

With EXACT statement, the exact version and it Monte Carlo approximation can be also conducted. However, it should be noted that the exact test, i.e., a permuation test takes a long time to compelete the task even for a small dataset.

## Example Code

```{r eval = FALSE}
proc datasets lib = work;
  delete inds / memtype = data;
run;
quit;

FILENAME REFFILE '/home/tsumiis1/SandBox/CAMIS/jonck.csv';

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=REFFILE
	DBMS=CSV
	OUT=WORK.inds;
	GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

proc freq data = inds;
  title "Asymptotic p-value calculation";
  table DOSE * value / jt;
  ods output JTTest = o_jt;
run;

proc freq data = inds;
  title "Approximation of exact test by resampling";
  table DOSE * value / jt;
  exact jt / mc seed = 4989 n = 10000 alpha = 0.05;
  ods output JTTestMC = o_jt_sim;
run;

```
